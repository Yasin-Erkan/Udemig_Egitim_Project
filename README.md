# Udemig_Egitim_Project
The "Udemig Education" project is a simple, yet effective educational website built using HTML and CSS. It aims to provide an intuitive and accessible interface for users seeking educational resources. The website includes key sections for educational services, making it easy to navigate and understand.
This is the second project I have developed using HTML and CSS. The "Udemig Education" website is designed to provide a clean and user-friendly interface for an educational platform.
